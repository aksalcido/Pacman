# Pacman
A Python influenced-version of the well known arcade game, Pacman. The game immediately starts when the `main.pyw` file is ran. The program does not contain a Main Menu, but does include levels and acceleration of the game. Losing all the lives results in a Game Over screen, and the program is done.
